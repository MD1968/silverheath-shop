### Concept:

The idea for the application followed news reports of the government looking into running trials of E-Scooters later this year. I was already researching the product to sell for the fourth project of course. Looking at www.halfords.co.uk I realised that a good selection is already on the market.
I decided to create a project using data and photos gained from Halfords.

The course materials from the Code Institute was also very valuable as a resource and inspiration.

### UI/UX:

I wanted the site to be clean, clear and concise. <br>The general colour for the text, buttons, banners etc to be green to highlight the environmentally friendly credentials of the product available.
<br>The page background has been coded to be white so not to distract from the item information and page contents.  <br>The buttons, banners have also been placed and coloured as not to distract from the overall message.

### User stories: 

### General visitor:

### Browsing:

The ability to browse the project range. Short projects by Name, Range, Charge time, Price. Filter by size (Child or Adult). 

### Shopping:

Selection of a product by either entering quantity or clicking on button for a single item. <br>The shopping trolley icon on the top of the screen will change colour and show the value in the shopping cart
From the cart the shopper can add, amend or remove their products from the cart summary screen. Then when happy move onto a secure and easy to follow check out process. 

### Profile:
The user can create an account for recurring visits. This can be easily achieved by selecting on the icon on the top of the screen. They are taken to a page to allow them to create an account or login if they already have a account. Also present is the ability to reset their password. The reset password link will be emailed once the visitor has entered their details
Once logged in the visitor can enter their contact details and review past orders.
